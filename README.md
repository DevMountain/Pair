# Six Week Technical Challenge

In response to [Christopher Burke's answer](http://qr.ae/RCI2cL) to the question ['What is the difference between a programmer, a good programmer, and a great programmer?'](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-programmer-a-good-programmer-and-a-great-programmer) we have built this technical challenge to assess where you are at after six weeks.

The details of the challenge are included below. Hints are included in the Guidelines.md file. Do your best to complete the challenge independently, without the hints or guidelines. However, use them if you are stuck for 20 minutes.

## The Challenge

Fork this repository. Complete the challenge, push your version with a clear commit history to your own Github profile.

Write a single view Pair Randomizer application that takes a list of objects and pairs them together. Potential use cases may be creating an app for Pair Programming teams, or matching people for a Secret Santa gift exchange. Add the following features:

1. Add entities to a list in a table list view
2. Display a list of the added entities grouped by section
3. Include a button that allows me to randomize the list
4. Persist the list of entities

Take as much time as needed to complete the challenge. Add a note at the bottom of this README.md file with how long it took you to complete the challenge.

Example:

```Completed in 3.5 hours.```
