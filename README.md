# Six Week Technical Challenge

In response to [Christopher Burke's answer](http://qr.ae/RCI2cL) to the question ['What is the difference between a programmer, a good programmer, and a great programmer?'](http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-a-programmer-a-good-programmer-and-a-great-programmer) we have built this technical challenge to assess where you are at after six weeks.

The details of the challenge are included below. Hints are included in the Guidelines.md file. Do your best to complete the challenge independently, without the hints or guidelines. However, use them if you are stuck for 20 minutes.

Please look at the provided screenshots before starting. They demonstrate the application you are to create for this assessment and can be found on [this github page](https://github.com/DevMountain/Pair/edit/master).

## The Challenge

Fork this repository. Complete the challenge, push your version with a clear commit history to your own Github profile.

Write a single view Pair Randomizer application that takes a list of objects and pairs them together. Potential use cases may be creating an app for Pair Programming teams, or matching people for a Secret Santa gift exchange. Add the following features:

1. Add entities to a list in a table list view
2. Display a list of the added entities grouped by section
3. Include a button that allows me to randomize the list
4. Implement swipe to delete for individual entities
5. Persist the list of entities

Note: You may use CoreData for persistence but you *MAY NOT* use a NSFetchedResultsController
